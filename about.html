        We are in an important position of trust – with our audiences, with artists and companies
        we work with, local communities, donors, partners, sponsors, and funders. And of course,
        with our Barbican Team who welcome audiences and artists into our spaces every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are governed by the Barbican Centre Board – a committee of the City of London Corporation,
        our founder and principal funder. At all times we aim to work in accordance with our purpose
        and values, using our spaces and resources for public benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the Barbican everybody is welcome, and should be treated equitably, with honesty and respect.
        We expect everybody – whether working, visiting, or performing – to abide by our Zero Tolerance
        Statement. Additionally, Barbican staff must adhere to the City of London’s Code of Conduct.
