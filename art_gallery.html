      <h1>Barbican<br />Art Gallery</h1>
      <p>
        Since Barbican Art Gallery opened in March 1982, our visual arts programme has embraced art,
        architecture, design, fashion, photography and film.
        <br /><br />
        The Archive allows you to look back through the decades to discover past exhibitions and events
        in the Art Gallery, in The Curve, in locations around the Barbican and off-site.
        <br /><br />
        The Curve commission series has been running since 2006, and we also present smaller commissions
        and exhibitions in the Barbican Foyers.
