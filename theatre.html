      <h1>Barbican<br />Theatre</h1>
      <p>
        Our Theatre is world-renowned for its construction and famous production history.
        <br /><br />
        Seating 1154 people, our Theatre has an intimate feel with no seat located further than 20 metres from the stage. It's an ideal venue for conferences, award ceremonies or private events.
        <br /><br />
        All guests have excellent sightlines with tiered seating. Our acoustics in the venue are geared to the requirements of international production companies, with a blank canvas stage allowing for bespoke production.
